//! All models share one streaming contract: a model-specific [`FrameDenoiser`]
//! (native rate + fixed frame size + per-frame processing) wrapped by the
//! model-agnostic [`FixedDelayAdapter`], which owns resampling, frame
//! accumulation, and the fixed-delay output timeline. New models (GTCRN,
//! DeepFilterNet3) slot in as additional `FrameDenoiser` impls — they must reuse
//! this seam, not invent a parallel structure.
